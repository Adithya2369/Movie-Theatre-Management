# Multiplex Movie Theatre Management System

## Overview

This project is a web-based management system for a multiplex movie theatre. It is designed to help theatre administrators, staff, and customers interact efficiently with all aspects of movie screenings, bookings, and theatre operations. The system provides an intuitive interface for each user role, making movie management and ticket booking seamless and transparent.

## Key Features

- **Movie Listings:**  
  All movies currently being shown are displayed with their details, making it easy for customers and staff to browse available options.

- **Showtimes and Fixed Slots:**  
  Screenings are scheduled in fixed time slots throughout the day, ensuring clarity and consistency for both customers and theatre management.

- **Seat Booking:**  
  Customers can view available seats for a show and book them in real time. Once booked, seats become unavailable to others, preventing double-booking.

- **Admin Dashboard:**  
  Administrators have access to a powerful dashboard where they can:
  - Add, edit, or remove movies and screenings.
  - Create new screens (auditoriums) and define their seating arrangements.
  - Monitor bookings for each movie, including which seats are booked and by whom.
  - View statistics such as total bookings and revenue per movie.

- **Staff Portal:**  
  Staff members have a read-only view of movies, screens, and bookings. This allows them to assist customers and monitor theatre operations without making changes to the system.

- **Role-Based Access:**  
  The system recognizes three types of users: administrators, staff, and customers. Each role has access to different features, ensuring security and operational integrity.

- **User-Friendly Interface:**  
  The web interface is designed to be clean, responsive, and easy to navigate for all users, whether they are booking a ticket or managing the theatre.

## How It Works

- **Customers** can register, log in, browse movies, view showtimes, select seats, and book tickets. After booking, they receive a confirmation with their seat numbers.
- **Staff** log in to view all movies, showtimes, and bookings in a read-only format, enabling them to provide support and manage on-ground operations.
- **Admins** log in to a special dashboard where they can manage all aspects of the theatre, including adding movies, scheduling shows, creating screens, and monitoring all bookings and statistics.

## Why This Project Matters

Running a multiplex theatre involves coordinating many moving parts: multiple movies, overlapping showtimes, hundreds of seats, and thousands of customers. This system brings order to that complexity by providing a single, unified platform for all users. It reduces errors, prevents double-bookings, and gives management real-time insights into theatre performance.

The system is designed to be scalable, secure, and easy to use, making it suitable for both small cinemas and large multiplexes.

## Who Can Use This System?

- **Cinema Owners & Managers:** For managing daily operations efficiently.
- **Theatre Staff:** For assisting customers and monitoring bookings.
- **Moviegoers:** For a smooth, modern ticket booking experience.

## Summary

This project transforms the traditional movie theatre experience into a modern, digital, and user-friendly process. Whether you are a customer booking a seat, a staff member checking bookings, or an admin managing the entire theatre, this system is built to make your job easier and your experience better.
